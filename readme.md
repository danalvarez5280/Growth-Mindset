The growth mindset gear up was really interesting because it made me look back at my entire schooling career. Since an early age I was always taught that getting the right answer was more important than truly understanding the topic. However, truly understanding the topic means that you have actually learned the topic. I like the idea of not stopping your learning just because you have the answer you need but keep learning so you will know the right answer in the future.
